    <h3>Prerequisites for Reading this Book</h3>

<p>In the first seven chapters in this book, the focus is on data analysis and not programming. For those
seven chapters, I do not assume a detailed familiarity with topics such as software design, algorithms, data
structures, and such. I do not expect you to have any experience with the R programming language either.
I do, however, expect that you have had some experience with programming, mathematical modeling, and
statistics.</p>
<p>Programming R can be quite tricky at times if you are familiar with a scripting language or objectoriented languages. R is a functional language that does not allow you to modify data, and while it does
have systems for object-oriented programming, it handles this programming paradigm very differently from
languages you are likely to have seen such as Java or Python.

For the data analysis part of this book, the first seven chapters, we will only use R for very
straightforward programming tasks, so none of this should pose a problem. We will have to write simple
scripts for manipulating and summarizing data so you should be familiar with how to write basic
expressions like function calls, if statements, loops, and so on. These things you will have to be comfortable
with. I will introduce every such construction in the book when we need them so you will see how they are
expressed in R, but I will not spend much time explaining them. I mostly will just expect you to be able to
pick it up from examples.</p>
<p>
Similarly, I do not expect you to know already how to fit data and compare models in R. I do expect that
you have had enough introduction to statistics to be comfortable with basic terms like parameter estimation,
model fitting, explanatory and response variables, and model comparison. If not, I expect you to be at least
able to pick up what we are talking about when you need to.
I won’t expect you to know a lot about statistics and programming, but this isn’t Data Science for
Dummies, so I do expect you to be able to figure out examples without me explaining everything in detail.
After the first seven chapters is a short description of a data analysis project, one of my students did
in an earlier class. It shows how such a project could look, but I suggest that you do not wait until you have
finished the first seven chapters to start doing such analysis yourself. To get the most benefit out of reading
this book, you should be applying what you learn continuously. Already when you begin reading, I suggest
that you find a dataset that you would be interested in finding out more about and then apply what you learn
in each chapter to that data.Prerequisites for Reading this Book
